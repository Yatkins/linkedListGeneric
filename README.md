# Linked List Stack VS Que

In LinkedList, we implemented a Stack - FIFO (First in, First out). 

Methods for a Stack are push() and pop().

Here, we are implementing LinkedList as a Que - LIFO (Last in, First out). 

Methods for a Que are queue() and enqueue().

### Instructions

Implement Que, determin what makes Ques slower than Stack and modify to improve performace of Que.

Implement size(), end(), and get(n) methods using recursion.
